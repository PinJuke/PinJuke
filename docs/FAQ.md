# FAQ

### What license does PinJuke music player have?

This software is provided under the GPL-3 license.

This software depends on many other (awesome!) code bases (e.g. libraries), some of which are provided under the GPL-3 license.

### I would like to contribute to the code base or build the software myself by its source code.

See instructions for [building](BUILDING.md) the software.
